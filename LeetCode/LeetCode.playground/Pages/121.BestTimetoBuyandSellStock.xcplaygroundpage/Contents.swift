/*
 You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
 You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
 Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 Example 1:
 Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
 Output: 5
 Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
 Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
